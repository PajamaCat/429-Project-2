For Distance Vector protocol

Things to test:
1. Correct shortest path
2. When a link dies, 
	a. other routers won't route through this link
	b. other routers can figure out which link died and establish a new shortest path without 
	routing to the dead link
	c. dead entries should expire
3. When a link cost change,
	a. routers on this link should detect the change and send out new DV msg
	b. other routers should be able to update shortest route according to the cost change
4. When a new link coming up,
	a. its linked routers should detect this, add new nbr_entry, dv_entry and forwarding entry accordingly
	b. new routing paths may be established

There's another test: test_case_complex to test whether the protocol can handle complicated
node relationship.
